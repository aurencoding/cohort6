console.log("hello world")


console.log("2", 2)

console.log("this is a number", 2)

// string of 2 plus 2 = 22

console.log("hello" + "my" + "name" + "is" + "bob")

// addition operator acts strangely. cancatination, cancat things together, add all words together next to each other

// that's why 2 + 2 = 22 because it's just putting them next to each other like text

console.log (2 + 2)

// now acting as addition operator, when used with strings it's a cancatinating operator
